# ðŸ§  Parkinson's Disease Detection

An AI-powered machine learning project designed to detect **Parkinson's disease** using biomedical voice measurements.  
This project applies advanced data analysis and classification algorithms to assist in the early detection of Parkinsonâ€™s, enabling timely diagnosis and intervention.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and speech. Early detection is crucial for improving treatment outcomes.  
In this project, we analyze a dataset containing voice features from healthy individuals and Parkinson's patients, training a machine learning model to classify whether a person may have Parkinson's disease.
